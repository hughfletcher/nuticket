## NuTicket

Nuticket is an open source ticket system created out of the lack of any modern open source systems available. The goal of NuTicket is to provide a quality, well tested, feature packed ticketing/issues application that can be easily extended as much as possible.

## Official Documentation

Documentation for NuTicket can be found on the [Wiki](https://github.com/hughfletcher/nuticket/wiki).

## Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to NuTicket! Review the issues for any help you can provide. Be sure to reply with your intentions, so everyone can be on the same page.

## Installation

There is no official installer yet, and as such, the best way to install would be to do `git clone` of the repo and then configure the `config\database.php`. Until more fleshed out installation options come, please feel free to open an issue with any questions.
